## <a name="reporting"></a>Issue reporting

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
  (a.k.a. `master`).

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-python). If you would like to implement a new feature then
consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be
  discussed first with `csharp-socketlabs` contributors in an issue or pull request so
  that we can develop a proper solution and better coordinate our efforts,
  prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is
  successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-python) as a Pull Request.
  
  ## <a name="pull"></a> Creating a Pull Request?
  
- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.

- From your fork open a pull request with a clear title and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
